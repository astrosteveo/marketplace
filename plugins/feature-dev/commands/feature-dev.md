# Feature Development

Use the feature-development skill to implement this feature request:

$ARGUMENTS

Follow the complete 6-phase workflow:

1. **Discovery & Exploration** - Explore codebase immediately, understand patterns
2. **Clarifying Questions** - Ask informed questions based on exploration findings
3. **Architecture** - Design and compare approaches
4. **Implementation** - Build incrementally with verification
5. **Review** - Ensure quality with tests and code review
6. **Summary** - Document completion and suggest follow-ups

**Note**: Impact Analysis (Phase 3.5) triggers automatically when changes affect >5 files or critical systems.

Refer to the skill's reference files for detailed guidance:
