Plan complete and saved to docs/plans/auth-system/plan.md.

Three execution options:
1. Subagent-Driven (this session) - I dispatch a fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration within this conversation
2. Fresh Session (this terminal) - Clear context and execute with full focus on implementation
3. Parallel Session (separate) - Open a new Claude Code session with the execute-plan skill, continuous execution with clean context

Which approach do you want to use for implementation?

[Your response]:
subagent-driven-development, please
