# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

Guide completion of development work by presenting clear options and handling chosen workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify clean state → Verify tests → Confirm manual checks → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Clean State

**Check for uncommitted changes:**

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

**If uncommitted changes exist:**
```
Found uncommitted changes:
[list files]

Options:
1. Commit these changes now
2. Stash for later
3. Discard changes

Which option?
```

Handle choice before proceeding.

**Check for untracked files:**

Same command shows untracked files. Ask user:
```
Found untracked files:
[list files]

Options:
1. Add and commit these files
2. Add to .gitignore
3. Leave untracked (will not be included)

Which option?
```

**Check for unpushed commits:**

```bash
git log origin/$(git branch --show-current)..HEAD --oneline 2>/dev/null
```

If commits exist and branch has remote, push before proceeding:
```bash
git push
```

**Only proceed to Step 2 when:**
- No uncommitted changes
- Untracked files handled (committed, ignored, or acknowledged)
- All commits pushed

### Step 2: Verify Tests

**Before presenting options, verify tests pass:**

```bash
# Run project's test suite
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:**
```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]

Cannot proceed with merge/PR until tests pass.
```

Stop. Don't proceed to Step 3.

**If tests pass:** Continue to Step 3.

### Step 3: Confirm Manual Verification

**Ask user to confirm:**

```
Before finishing, please confirm:
- Have you had a chance to perform any manual checks?
- Are you satisfied with the implementation?

Ready to proceed? (yes/no)
```

**If no:** Ask what needs to be addressed before finishing.

**If yes:** Continue to Step 4.

### Step 4: Capture Discovered Issues

**Ask user:**

```
During this work, did you notice any bugs, improvement opportunities, or
ideas for future features unrelated to this branch?

If yes, I'll create GitHub issues before we finish.
```

**If issues mentioned:**
```bash
gh issue create --title "[scope] Brief description" --label "enhancement" --body "..."
```

Create one issue per item. This preserves insights without scope creep.

### Step 5: Determine Base Branch

```bash
# Try common base branches
git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null
```

Or ask: "This branch split from main - is that correct?"

### Step 6: Present Options

Present exactly these 4 options:

```
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option?
```

**Don't add explanation** - keep options concise.

### Step 7: Execute Choice

#### Option 1: Merge Locally

```bash
# Switch to base branch
git checkout <base-branch>

# Pull latest
git pull

# Merge feature branch
git merge <feature-branch>

# Verify tests on merged result
<test command>

# If tests pass
git branch -d <feature-branch>
```

Then: Archive artifacts (Step 8) and cleanup worktree (Step 9)

#### Option 2: Push and Create PR

```bash
# Push branch
git push -u origin <feature-branch>

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<2-3 bullets of what changed>

## Test Plan
- [ ] <verification steps>
EOF
)"
```

Then: Archive artifacts (Step 8) and cleanup worktree (Step 9)

#### Option 3: Keep As-Is

Report: "Keeping branch <name>. Worktree preserved at <path>."

**Don't cleanup worktree.**

#### Option 4: Discard

**Confirm first:**
```
This will permanently delete:
- Branch <name>
- All commits: <commit-list>
- Worktree at <path>

Type 'discard' to confirm.
```

Wait for exact confirmation.

If confirmed:
```bash
git checkout <base-branch>
git branch -D <feature-branch>
```

Then: Archive artifacts (Step 8) and cleanup worktree (Step 9)

### Step 8: Archive Artifacts

**For Options 1 and 2 (merge/PR):**

If `.artifacts/<feature-slug>/` exists for this feature:

```bash
mkdir -p .artifacts/archive
mv .artifacts/<feature-slug> .artifacts/archive/
git add .artifacts/
git commit -m "chore: archive <feature-slug> artifacts"
```

**For Option 3:** Keep artifacts in place (work continues later).

**For Option 4:** Delete artifacts with the branch.

### Step 9: Cleanup Worktree

**For Options 1, 2, 4:**

Check if in worktree:
```bash
git worktree list | grep $(git branch --show-current)
```

If yes:
```bash
git worktree remove <worktree-path>
```

**For Option 3:** Keep worktree.

## Quick Reference

| Option | Merge | Push | Archive | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
|--------|-------|------|---------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Merge locally | ✓ | - | ✓ | - | ✓ |
| 2. Create PR | - | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| 3. Keep as-is | - | - | - | ✓ | - |
| 4. Discard | - | - | delete | - | ✓ (force) |

## Common Mistakes

**Skipping clean state verification**
- **Problem:** Uncommitted changes lost, unpushed commits forgotten
- **Fix:** Always check git status and push before finishing

**Skipping test verification**
- **Problem:** Merge broken code, create failing PR
- **Fix:** Always verify tests before offering options

**Open-ended questions**
- **Problem:** "What should I do next?" → ambiguous
- **Fix:** Present exactly 4 structured options

**Automatic worktree cleanup**
- **Problem:** Remove worktree when might need it (Option 2, 3)
- **Fix:** Only cleanup for Options 1 and 4

**No confirmation for discard**
- **Problem:** Accidentally delete work
- **Fix:** Require typed "discard" confirmation

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Proceed with uncommitted changes or unpushed commits
- Proceed with failing tests
- Merge without verifying tests on result
- Delete work without confirmation
- Force-push without explicit request

**Always:**
- Verify clean state (no uncommitted changes, commits pushed) first
- Verify tests before offering options
- Confirm user is satisfied with implementation before finishing
- Present exactly 4 options
- Get typed confirmation for Option 4
- Archive artifacts for Options 1 & 2
- Clean up worktree for Options 1 & 4 only

## Integration

**Called by:**
- **subagent-driven-development** (Step 7) - After all tasks complete
- **executing-plans** (Step 5) - After all batches complete

**Pairs with:**
- **using-git-worktrees** - Cleans up worktree created by that skill
