# Agent Development for Claude Code Plugins

## Overview

Agents are autonomous subprocesses that handle complex, multi-step tasks independently. Understanding agent structure, triggering conditions, and system prompt design enables creating powerful autonomous capabilities.

**Key concepts:**
- Agents are FOR autonomous work, commands are FOR user-initiated actions
- Markdown file format with YAML frontmatter
- Triggering via description field with examples
- System prompt defines agent behavior
- Model and color customization

## Agent File Structure

### Complete Format

```markdown
---
name: agent-identifier
description: Use this agent when [triggering conditions]. Examples:

<example>
Context: [Situation description]
user: "[User request]"
assistant: "[How assistant should respond and use this agent]"
<commentary>
[Why this agent should be triggered]
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
[Additional example...]
</example>

model: inherit
color: blue
tools: ["Read", "Write", "Grep"]
---

You are [agent role description]...

**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. [Responsibility 1]
2. [Responsibility 2]

**Analysis Process:**
[Step-by-step workflow]

**Output Format:**
[What to return]
```

## Frontmatter Fields

### name (required)

Agent identifier used for namespacing and invocation.

**Format:** lowercase, numbers, hyphens only
**Length:** 3-50 characters
**Pattern:** Must start and end with alphanumeric

**Good examples:**
- `code-reviewer`
- `test-generator`
- `api-docs-writer`
- `security-analyzer`

**Bad examples:**
- `helper` (too generic)
- `-agent-` (starts/ends with hyphen)
- `my_agent` (underscores not allowed)
- `ag` (too short, < 3 chars)

### description (required)

Defines when Claude should trigger this agent. **This is the most critical field.**

**Must include:**
1. Triggering conditions ("Use this agent when...")
2. Multiple `<example>` blocks showing usage
3. Context, user request, and assistant response in each example
4. `<commentary>` explaining why agent triggers

**Format:**
```
Use this agent when [conditions]. Examples:

<example>
Context: [Scenario description]
user: "[What user says]"
assistant: "[How Claude should respond]"
<commentary>
[Why this agent is appropriate]
</commentary>
</example>

[More examples...]
```

**Best practices:**
- Include 2-4 concrete examples
- Show proactive and reactive triggering
- Cover different phrasings of same intent
- Explain reasoning in commentary
- Be specific about when NOT to use the agent

### model (required)

Which model the agent should use.

**Options:**
- `inherit` - Use same model as parent (recommended)
- `sonnet` - Claude Sonnet (balanced)
- `opus` - Claude Opus (most capable, expensive)
- `haiku` - Claude Haiku (fast, cheap)

**Recommendation:** Use `inherit` unless agent needs specific model capabilities.

### color (required)

Visual identifier for agent in UI.

**Options:** `blue`, `cyan`, `green`, `yellow`, `magenta`, `red`

**Guidelines:**
- Choose distinct colors for different agents in same plugin
- Use consistent colors for similar agent types
- Blue/cyan: Analysis, review
- Green: Success-oriented tasks
- Yellow: Caution, validation
- Red: Critical, security
- Magenta: Creative, generation

### tools (optional)

Restrict agent to specific tools.

**Format:** Array of tool names

```yaml
tools: ["Read", "Write", "Grep", "Bash"]
```

**Default:** If omitted, agent has access to all tools

**Best practice:** Limit tools to minimum needed (principle of least privilege)

**Common tool sets:**
- Read-only analysis: `["Read", "Grep", "Glob"]`
- Code generation: `["Read", "Write", "Grep"]`
- Testing: `["Read", "Bash", "Grep"]`
- Full access: Omit field or use `["*"]`

### disallowedTools (optional)

Prevent agent from using specific tools.

**Format:** Array of tool name patterns

```yaml
disallowedTools: ["Edit", "Bash"]
```

**Use when:** Agent should have broad access but certain tools should be blocked (inverse of `tools`).

### skills (optional)

Preload specific skills when agent starts.

**Format:** Array of skill paths relative to the plugin

```yaml
skills: ["skills/hook-development", "skills/mcp-integration"]
```

**Use when:** Agent needs specialized knowledge from plugin skills without waiting for auto-triggering.

### memory (optional)

Configure agent memory access and storage.

**Format:** Object with memory type configuration

```yaml
memory:
  user: true
  project: true
  local: true
```

**Memory types:**
- `user`: `~/.claude/memory/` — Persists across all projects
- `project`: `.claude/memory/` — Shared across team, committed to git
- `local`: `.claude/local-memory/` — Local to machine, not committed

**Use when:** Agent benefits from persistent context across sessions.

### hooks (optional)

Define hooks active only while this agent is running.

**Format:** Hook configuration object (same format as hooks.json)

```yaml
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Write"
      hooks:
        - type: prompt
          prompt: "Validate this write for the agent's specific constraints"
  Stop:
    - matcher: "*"
      hooks:
        - type: prompt
          prompt: "Verify agent completed all assigned tasks"
```

**Use when:** Agent needs specialized validation or behavior that shouldn't apply globally.

### permissionMode (optional)

Set the agent's permission behavior.

**Format:** String

```yaml
permissionMode: "bypassPermissions"
```

**Options:**
- `"default"` — Normal permission prompts (default)
- `"acceptEdits"` — Auto-accept file edits
- `"bypassPermissions"` — Skip all permission prompts
- `"plan"` — Require plan approval before implementing

**Use with caution:** `bypassPermissions` should only be used for trusted, well-tested agents. Document the permission mode and rationale in the agent description.

## System Prompt Design

The markdown body becomes the agent's system prompt. Write in second person, addressing the agent directly.

### Structure

**Standard template:**
```markdown
You are [role] specializing in [domain].

**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. [Primary responsibility]
2. [Secondary responsibility]
3. [Additional responsibilities...]

**Analysis Process:**
1. [Step one]
2. [Step two]
3. [Step three]
[...]

**Quality Standards:**
- [Standard 1]
- [Standard 2]

**Output Format:**
Provide results in this format:
- [What to include]
- [How to structure]

**Edge Cases:**
Handle these situations:
- [Edge case 1]: [How to handle]
- [Edge case 2]: [How to handle]
```

### Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Write in second person ("You are...", "You will...")
- Be specific about responsibilities
- Provide step-by-step process
- Define output format
- Include quality standards
- Address edge cases
- Keep under 10,000 characters

❌ **DON'T:**
- Write in first person ("I am...", "I will...")
- Be vague or generic
- Omit process steps
- Leave output format undefined
- Skip quality guidance
- Ignore error cases

## Creating Agents

### Method 1: AI-Assisted Generation

Use this prompt pattern (extracted from Claude Code):

```
Create an agent configuration based on this request: "[YOUR DESCRIPTION]"

Requirements:
1. Extract core intent and responsibilities
2. Design expert persona for the domain
3. Create comprehensive system prompt with:
   - Clear behavioral boundaries
   - Specific methodologies
   - Edge case handling
   - Output format
4. Create identifier (lowercase, hyphens, 3-50 chars)
5. Write description with triggering conditions
6. Include 2-3 <example> blocks showing when to use

Return JSON with:
{
  "identifier": "agent-name",
  "whenToUse": "Use this agent when... Examples: <example>...</example>",
  "systemPrompt": "You are..."
}
```

Then convert to agent file format with frontmatter.

See `examples/agent-creation-prompt.md` for complete template.

### Method 2: Manual Creation

1. Choose agent identifier (3-50 chars, lowercase, hyphens)
2. Write description with examples
3. Select model (usually `inherit`)
4. Choose color for visual identification
5. Define tools (if restricting access)
6. Write system prompt with structure above
7. Save as `agents/agent-name.md`

## Validation Rules

### Identifier Validation

```
✅ Valid: code-reviewer, test-gen, api-analyzer-v2
❌ Invalid: ag (too short), -start (starts with hyphen), my_agent (underscore)
```

**Rules:**
- 3-50 characters
- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
- Must start and end with alphanumeric
- No underscores, spaces, or special characters

### Description Validation

**Length:** 10-5,000 characters
**Must include:** Triggering conditions and examples
**Best:** 200-1,000 characters with 2-4 examples

### System Prompt Validation

**Length:** 20-10,000 characters
**Best:** 500-3,000 characters
**Structure:** Clear responsibilities, process, output format

## Agent Organization

### Plugin Agents Directory

```
plugin-name/
└── agents/
    ├── analyzer.md
    ├── reviewer.md
    └── generator.md
```

All `.md` files in `agents/` are auto-discovered.

### Namespacing

Agents are namespaced automatically:
- Single plugin: `agent-name`
- With subdirectories: `plugin:subdir:agent-name`

## Testing Agents

### Test Triggering

Create test scenarios to verify agent triggers correctly:

1. Write agent with specific triggering examples
2. Use similar phrasing to examples in test
3. Check Claude loads the agent
4. Verify agent provides expected functionality

### Test System Prompt

Ensure system prompt is complete:

1. Give agent typical task
2. Check it follows process steps
3. Verify output format is correct
4. Test edge cases mentioned in prompt
5. Confirm quality standards are met

## Built-in Subagent Types

Claude Code provides built-in subagent types with predefined tool sets. Custom agents (in `agents/`) supplement these:

| Type | Tools Available | Use For |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Explore | Read, Grep, Glob (no Edit/Write) | Codebase exploration, search |
| Plan | Read, Grep, Glob (no Edit/Write) | Architecture planning, design |
| General-purpose | All tools | Complex multi-step tasks |
| Bash | Bash only | Command execution |

**Selection guide:**
- Use **Explore** when agent only needs to read and search
- Use **Plan** for design and planning tasks
- Use **General-purpose** for tasks requiring file changes
- Use **Bash** for pure command-line operations
- Use **custom agents** (your `agents/` directory) for domain-specific behavior

## Agent Storage and Loading Precedence

Agents load from multiple locations with this priority (highest first):

1. `--agents` CLI flag — Explicit path override
2. `.claude/agents/` — Project-level agents
3. `~/.claude/agents/` — User-level agents
4. Plugin `agents/` directories — Plugin-provided agents

When agents with the same name exist at multiple levels, the higher-priority location wins.

## Background Agent Execution

Agents can run in the background using Ctrl+B or the `run_in_background` parameter:

**Design considerations for background-compatible agents:**
- Ensure agents complete autonomously without needing user input
- Use clear, self-contained instructions
- Handle errors gracefully (no AskUserQuestion in background)
- Output results to files or task updates rather than interactive responses
- Test agents work correctly without real-time user interaction

## Quick Reference

### Minimal Agent

```markdown
---
name: simple-agent
description: Use this agent when... Examples: <example>...</example>
model: inherit
color: blue
---

You are an agent that [does X].

Process:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]

Output: [What to provide]
```

### Frontmatter Fields Summary

- ✅ Choose appropriate tools (least privilege)
- ✅ Write clear, structured system prompts
- ✅ Test agent triggering thoroughly

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Use generic descriptions without examples

## Implementation Workflow

To create an agent for a plugin:

1. Define agent purpose and triggering conditions
2. Choose creation method (AI-assisted or manual)
3. Create `agents/agent-name.md` file
4. Write frontmatter with all required fields
5. Write system prompt following best practices
6. Include 2-4 triggering examples in description
7. Validate with `scripts/validate-agent.sh`
8. Test triggering with real scenarios
9. Document agent in plugin README

Focus on clear triggering conditions and comprehensive system prompts for autonomous operation.
