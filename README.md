## Philosophy

The Harness ecosystem is built on these principles:

- **YAGNI** - You Aren't Gonna Need It (don't add complexity prematurely)
- **TDD First** - Write tests before implementation, always
- **Systematic over Ad-hoc** - Follow proven processes over guessing
- **Evidence over Claims** - Verify before declaring success
- **Skills, not Scripts** - Teach Claude patterns, don't force behavior
